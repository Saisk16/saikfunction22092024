Colab started as a tool built by a small team at Google Research who felt there was a better way to collaborate and iterate in the field of machine learning. Now itâ€™s grown to more than 10 million monthly active users, including millions of students globally, making it Google's largest AI-enabled coding tool. Colab provides developers with frictionless access to powerful computing resources, free of charge, without having to install or manage any software. With its smooth Google Drive integration, it's one of the easiest ways to start programming in Python.
